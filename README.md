## Blind Search Algorithm/Hill Climbing/Simulated Annealing

Using a either blind search, hill climbing or simulated annealing to find out the global minimum of the designated functions. It also prints the the function on the x,y,z axis and the calculated point.
Usage: `python main.py ackley hill_climbing`

## Genetic Algorithm

Using a genetic algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem for the cities on the `cities.json` file.
Usage: `python main.py`

## Permutations of a sequence of elements

Finding out all of the permutations of a sequence of numbers taking as input the size of the sequence.
For instance `python main.py 2` will generate the sequence `01` and the permutations are `01` and `10`
It also prints the time it took to calculate them all.
