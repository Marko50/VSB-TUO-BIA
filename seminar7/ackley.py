# The Ackley function is widely used for testing optimization algorithms.
# In its two-dimensional form, as shown in the plot above, it is characterized by a nearly flat outer region, and a large hole at the centre. The function poses a risk for optimization algorithms, particularly hillclimbing algorithms, to be trapped in one of its many local minima.
# Recommended variable values are: a = 20, b = 0.2 and c = 2Ï€.
